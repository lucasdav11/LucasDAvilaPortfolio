# Genetic Algorithm

This project simulates a genetic algorithm discussed in AI.  It creates a random map and an array of 100 bots, each with a random
assortment of 'DNA', or a set list of moves.  The bots then each run through the given map and attempt to survive as long as possible.
The most fit bots are then sorted at the top of the array and then made to breed with each other spawning each another 50 bots.
This then clears the 'unfit' bots from the array and overwrites them.  This simulation is then run several times while outputing
the best score for each generation.  Once all the simulations have been completed, the output demonstrates a rapid growth in 
scores for each generation of bots up until it reaches its relative maximum.
