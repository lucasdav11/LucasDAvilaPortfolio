# Command Line Pokemon

This project is a basic command line verison of Pokemon. The user begins by starting a new save file or loading up a previous one.  If a new game is selected, the user creates his trainer and begins by choosing his starter pokemon.  There are three different maps to travel to and each one has both wild pokemon and trainers for the user to battle!  Players can choose to visit the PokeMart or PokemonCenter to help aid them during their travels.  Enjoy!
