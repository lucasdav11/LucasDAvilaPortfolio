# Ball Breaker

Ball Breaker is a classic game where the user controls a paddle on the bottom of the game window and attempts to hit the moving ball
towards all the other bricks on the top of the window and destroy them.  This game includes collision detections so that each
brick is cleared once the ball makes contact.  The user can play with either their mouse or with the arrow keys.  Ball Breaker 
was created using java and demonstrates the use of GUI's and windows.
