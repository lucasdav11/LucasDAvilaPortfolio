# Borrow Me

BorrowMe is an android application created during my Intro to Software Engineering class.  This project focused on using
standard software development strategies to conceive a system from development all the way to deploiment.  BorrowMe is an app
that allows users to borrow books from fellow classmates.  The idea was that college students could potentially reach out
to other individuals with similar classes and majors and borrow books from one another instead of constantly spending money
on buying them.  Users can upload what books they own at home and loan them out to others while also searching through their
list of friends to find a book they might need.  Then two users can reach out to each other through messaging and set up an
accord to borrow or swap books for a semester.

Included in this folder is the requirement specification document along with test cases, sample outputs, and flow chart diagrams.
