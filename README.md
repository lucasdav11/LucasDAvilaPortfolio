# Lucas D'Avila Portfolio

This repository was created to showcase my best work as a computer scientist up to this point in my career.  All these projects are intended to demonstrate my skills as a programmer (coding in Java, C/C++) and my understanding of the fundamentals of computer science.  This portfolio includes a variety of different projects that demonstrate my knowledge of the fundamentals of OOP, Structured Programming, AI, and Software Development, including its process starting from inception to deployment.  To name a few, this portfolio a Pokemon game that utilizes the command line, a game that demonstrates the use of GUI's called Ball Breaker, and a demonstration of a genetic algorithm to increase the lifespan of simulated bots running in a randomly generated map.
